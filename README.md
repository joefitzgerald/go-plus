* Github: https://github.com/joefitzgerald/go-plus
* Atom: https://atom.io/packages/go-plus

## Installing

1. Install `go-plus`: `apm install go-plus` or open Atom and go to `Preferences > Install`, search for `go-plus`, and install it

## Overview

This package adds extra Atom functionality for the go language:

* Autocomplete using `gocode` (you _must_ have the `autocomplete-plus` package activated for this to work)
* Formatting source using `gofmt`, `goimports`, or `goreturns`
* Code quality inspection using `go vet`
* Linting using `golint`
* Syntax checking using `go build` and `go test`
* Display of test coverage using `go test -coverprofile`
* Go to definition using `godef`

## Example

## Platforms

The package is currently known to work on OS X, Windows (7+) and Ubuntu. CI jobs exist for OS X and Windows; Ubuntu CI is still in-progress.

### Detection Of Your Go Installation

The package will search the following locations (in order) for a `go` executable:

* All directories specified in the PATH environment variable
* OS X: `/usr/local/go/bin` (package installer)
* OS X: `/usr/local/bin` (Homebrew)
* Windows: `C:\go\bin` (package installer)
* Windows: `C:\tools\go\bin` (Chocolatey)

If you have go installed somewhere else, and *not available on the path*, specify the full path to the go executable in the `Go Installation` preference.

### GOPATH

Love it or hate it, `GOPATH` is very important in `go` land.

Syntax checking requires a valid `GOPATH` for the files you are checking. You
can set your `GOPATH` using one of two mechanisms:

* Using the environment: set the `$GOPATH` environment variable to the correct
  value
* Using `go-plus` preferences: set the `Go Path` preference

The environment (if set) is preferred over the `Go Path` preference by default.
You can change this by updating the `Environment Overrides Configuration`
preference.

The most common reason `GOPATH` might not be set in the environment is due to the
way OS X launches processes. When you launch Atom via processes created by
`launchd` (e.g. using Finder, the Dock, or Spotlight) it likely will not have
access to your `$GOPATH` if you set it in your shell initialization files (e.g.
`.bash_profile`, `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc).

Consider launching Atom via your shell – using the Atom Shell Commands – where
Atom should inherit your environment. Alternatively, try one of the suggestions
at http://apple.stackexchange.com/a/87283 to set the `GOPATH` for processes
launched by `launchd` (and their children, which will include Atom).

Setting the `Go Path` preference will ensure that you have a sensible fallback
for GOPATH if you have launched Atom without the `$GOPATH` environment variable
set.

If both the `Go Path` preference and the `$GOPATH` / `%GOPATH%` environment variable are
empty, `go-plus` will display a warning and will not perform `go build` / `go
test` powered syntax checking.

## Planned Features

The following features will be added soon:

* `godoc` integration ([#12](https://github.com/joefitzgerald/go-plus/issues/12))
* `gb` support
* go `vendor experiment` support
* `gorename` integration ([#174](https://github.com/joefitzgerald/go-plus/issues/174))
* ... and others: https://github.com/joefitzgerald/go-plus/issues

## Troubleshooting

### GOPATH

> <b>Question:</b> Why can't Atom see my GOPATH? I have set it and I see it in terminal?

> <b>Answer:</b> Did You Launch Atom Using The Shell Command?

(From Above):

The most common reason `GOPATH` might not be set in the environment on OS X is due to the way OS X launches processes. When you launch Atom via processes created by `launchd` (e.g. using Finder, the Dock, or Spotlight) it likely will not have access to your `$GOPATH` if you set it in your shell initialization files (e.g. `.bash_profile`, `.bashrc`, `.zshrc`, etc).
