* Github: https://github.com/joefitzgerald/go-plus
* Atom: https://atom.io/packages/go-plus

## Overview

This package includes the following functionality:

* Display information about your current go installation, by running `go version` and `go env`
* Autocomplete using `gocode`
* Format your code with `gofmt`, `goimports`, or `goreturns`;
  optionally run one of these tools on save of any `.go` file
* Run `go install .` and `go test -c -o {tempdir} .` to verify your code compiles
  and to keep `gocode` suggestions up to date
* Run a variety of linters (e.g. `golint`, `vet`, etc.) against your code using `gometalinter`
* Run tests, display test output, and display test coverage using `go test -coverprofile`
* Display documentation for identifiers in source code using
  [`gogetdoc`](https://github.com/zmb3/gogetdoc)
* Rename the symbol under your cursor using `gorename`
* Go to definition using `guru` or `godef`
* Highlight occurrences of an identifier using `guru`
* Find usages of an identifier using `guru`

You can add debug functionality to Atom by installing the following package:

* [go-debug](https://atom.io/packages/go-debug): Debug your package / tests using [`delve`](https://github.com/derekparker/delve)

## Builds

### How Are The Builds Performed?

The following commands are run for the directory of the current file:
* `go install .` (for normal `.go` files)
* `go test -o {tmpdir} -c .` (for `_test.go` files)

### Why Are You Running `go install` Instead Of `go build`?

`gocode` (and a few other tools, like `gotype`) work on `.a` files (i.e. the package object archive), and the way to keep these up to date is to run `go install` periodically. This ensures your autocomplete suggestions are kept up to date without having to resort to `gocode set autobuild true` :tada:.

### But What About `gb`?

We are open to suggestions for detecting a package which is built with gb; please feel free to submit a pull request that detects a gb package without any explicit configuration and runs it.

## Platforms

The package has CI for OS X, Windows and Ubuntu.

## Installing Missing Tools
